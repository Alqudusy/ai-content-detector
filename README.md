## Features

- **AI Word Detection**: Highlights words likely generated by AI.
- **Content Analysis**: Displays the percentage of AI-generated vs. human-written content.
- **Detailed Feedback**: Provides actionable suggestions for more accurate results.
- **Sentence-Level Analysis**: Evaluates each sentence individually for better understanding.
